# MATLAB Files 2019
MATLAB projects and labs from the past semester. I'll put them in .m and .mlx files for you to choose whichever file type you like to run (I personally like .mlx but .m is more traditional). 

I've also added the .xlsx file with car suspension data for CE_2 and the .jpg for another example in there as well. 

Enjoy!
